# POSIX-Shell
This repository contains a custom shell program implemented in C++. It includes basic shell functionalities such as command execution, input/output redirection, piping, and built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `ls`, and `pinfo`. The shell also supports history management and file search within the current directory.
